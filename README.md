# Bug.n 

[bug.n][1] is a tilling window manger for windows(win10,win11) operation system.

We can download zip package, extract, and just `bug.n.exe`. No need to download `AutoHotkey`, since we don't need to run it's source code.

The first time we run it, we can press `win+ctrl+e` to open a editor to custom it's configuration. The configuration should be located in `C:\User\xxx\AppData\Roming\bug.n` and named `Config.ini`.

After we write some configuration, we can press `win+control+r` to reload. Quit the program with `win+control+q`.
